## 🧠 Overview

**Exam05** is a 42 project divided into **two levels**:

### **Level 0**
- **bigint:** Implementation of a **big integer library** in C supporting addition, subtraction, and multiplication of arbitrarily large numbers.  
- **polyset:** A project focusing on **polynomial operations** and manipulating sets of numbers.  
- **vect2:** A 2D vector library implementing operations like addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and vector assignment.

### **Level 1**
- **life:** Implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life**, simulating cellular automata on a 2D grid with rules for cell birth, survival, and death.  
- **bsq (Biggest Square):** Algorithm that finds the **largest square** on a grid without obstacles, reading maps from input files and marking the solution.

This exam reinforces **data structures, algorithms, memory management, and modular programming** in C.
